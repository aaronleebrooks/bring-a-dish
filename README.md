##Introduction Bring a Dish allows you to use the ingredients you already have to create delicious recipes. There are over 10,000 different recipes and hundreds of different ingredients recognized.

##Use Case This is useful for when users have lots of food in the kitchen, but no clue what to cook. Bring a Dish allows for inspiration and motivation to cook delicious meals at home without wasting money on additional ingredients.

Each recipe tile is a link to the recipe, shows a brief description, as well as how many ingredients you have versus how many you are missing.

Bring a Dish uses jQuery 3.2.1 alongside HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. The API used is 'Spoonacular.'
